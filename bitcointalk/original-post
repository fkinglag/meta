Gridcoin has been upgraded announcing:
Gridcoin-Research
[GRC]



Why mine when you can research?

Advancing science, mathematics, technology, and understanding the world around us.

A secure blockchain developed on the philosophy of benefiting humanity.


Proof-of-Work algorithms have been criticized for wasting energy on meaningless equations in the mining process and for centralizing transaction processing by encouraging a specialized hardware arms race. Gridcoin introduces a Proof-of-Research algorithm that gives computers something productive to do. Instead of racing to solve meaningless equations, Gridcoin miners Researchers work on problems such as finding cures to diseases, mapping genomes, or climate studies, and are compensated for the work they do.   

Gridcoin rewards you for doing real work. Our goal is to divert computing power from wasteful hashing to productive computing, creating a supercomputing cluster that supports all kinds of scientific investigation and technology development. Access to supercomputers has traditionally been restricted to large research universities and corporations. By creating a large network of computing devices, complex computations once out of reach for most researchers are now possible. The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), an open computing platform that supports all kinds of hardware and adapts as technology changes, has been providing distributed supercomputing since 2002, but until now the network was limited to those willing to contribute their resources on a volunteer basis. A few cryptocurrencies have attempted to create a compensation mechanism to increase participation in research, such as Ripple, Curecoin, and Research Support Coin, but these have used a centralized model for determining reward distribution and selecting research topics. Gridcoin lets you decide what to research, and pays you for your research.

Gridcoin is built on top of BOINC and is not limited to any one program, algorithm, or type of hardware. BOINC supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. You don't need special hardware to participate and earn rewards for your contributions to research — the computer you use for a few hours every day can contribute to CPU-based scientific projects when you aren't using it, and you won’t waste electricity competing with GPUs or ASICs for rewards. Those with special GPU mining rigs can also participate in projects designed specifically for parallel computations and you don't have to worry about losing your ROI to the next generation of ASICs.  There are currently over 30 different projects available, each with its own hardware needs — some need CPUs, some need GPUs, and some need sensors. The diversity of hardware supported makes it possible to contribute to the network with almost any device, making it more secure and minimizing the centralization of mining power.   

The reward system is designed to pay you in the same way as a pay-per-share mining pool, so you are rewarded fairly based on the work you do — not by how fast you can solve a block. The devices you can use to contribute to scientific research through BOINC include CPU, GPU, Android, R-Pi, and ASICs, with more being added all the time.   

We ask for the community to join us as volunteers, developers, investors, and evangelists seeking to enable a fundamentally different paradigm for the blockchain and the benefits to humanity it can produce. 

Real world results

World Community Grid
http://www.youtube.com/embed/eKVtC7rJ438?wmode=opaque
World Community Grid distributes millions of small data-based computer-based experiments to thousands of volunteers' devices. It gathers the results and sends them back to researchers, who interrogate the data for patterns, getting them closer to those world-changing results - faster. Since it began, volunteers have helped scientists to complete thousands of years' work in a few short years. World Community Grid has enabled scientific breakthroughs in cancer treatment and solar energy research. Our research partners have published over 35 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journal based on research conducted on World Community Grid, advancing knowledge in health, poverty and sustainability. 

Rosetta@Home
Determining the 3-dimensional shapes of proteins in research that may ultimately lead to finding cures for some major human diseases. By running the Rosetta program on your computer while you don't need it you will help us speed up and extend our research in ways we couldn't possibly attempt without your help. You will also be helping our efforts at designing new proteins to fight diseases such as HIV, Malaria, Cancer, and Alzheimer's.  View disease related work: http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/rah_medical_relevance.php

POEM@home
The project intends to study how protein structure determines protein function, predict a protein's structure from its amino acid sequence, investigate how proteins interact with each other and understand how malfunctioning proteins can cause sickness. The resulting knowledge can then be used in the development of medical treatments.

30+ more projects covering areas of Science, Technology, Mathematics, Materials, Space Exploration and much, much more!
